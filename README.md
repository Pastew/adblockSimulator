# AdBlock Simulator

https://globalgamejam.org/2018/games/adblock-simulator

**NOTE**: Even though repo is named *transmission*, actually it contains source code for a game called *Adblock Simulator*. This is because following game is a jam entry (for [Global Game Jam 2018](https://globalgamejam.org)), and at the moment repo was created, only this year's jam theme was known (which is *transmission*, of course).

## Introduction

Your browser delivers to you great amount of data each day. However, alongside with your beloved cat pictures and memes there is always data you would rather not see - the ubiquitous demons of the web - the ADS. You probably use an ad blocker browser plugin, to help you hunt them down & forget they really exist. But do you think YOU can take it's place? 

In this little arcade/puzzle game you will be responsible for classifying correctly incoming packets of data. We will test your speed, observation skills and ability to multitask. Enjoy!  

## How to play

TODO.

## Q&A

**Q: How was the game built?**
